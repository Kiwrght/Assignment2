# Assignment2: U.S. Popualtion Table using REST API
This project builds a U.S. population table using data fetched from a REST API. The table is displayed on the HTML page and populated dynamically with JavaScript to show population data.  The project showcases how to use HTML for markup and JavaScript for fetching and processing data from a REST API to display the information in a table format.
## Files
```index.html``` : Contains the structure code for the  HTML page and table

```script.js``` : Contains the functional code for the HTML. Script fetches the data from the REST API and populates it into a row-by-row table.

## How it works
### HTML
The HTML file includes a simple table structure with headers like "Year," "Population," etc. These headers will represent the data being fetched.
### JavaScript
```script.js``` is responsible for fetching the U.S. population data from a REST API. Sort the data into rows corresponding to states and their population. Dynamically add rows to the table in the HTML file with the fetched data.
### REST API
A REST API is used to fetch the population data. The API will return the population details for each year, and JavaScript processes this data to present it in a table.

## Output
The overall Output is shown below:
